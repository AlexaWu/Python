# Counting Organizations

This application will read the mailbox data (mbox.txt) and count the number of email messages per organization (i.e. domain name of the email address) using a database with the following schema to maintain the counts.

>CREATE TABLE Counts (org TEXT, count INTEGER)

Run the program on **mbox.txt**. The data file for this application: http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox.txt.

Because the sample code is using an **UPDATE** statement and committing the results to the database as each record is read in the loop, it might take as long as a few minutes to process all the data. The commit insists on completely writing all the data to disk every time it is called.

The program can be speeded up greatly by moving the commit operation outside of the loop. In any database program, there is a balance between the number of operations you execute between commits and the importance of not losing the results of operations that have not yet been committed.

### Python code
```Javascript
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('emaildb.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Counts')

cur.execute('''
CREATE TABLE Counts (org TEXT, count INTEGER)''')

fname = input('Enter file name: ')
if (len(fname) < 1): fname = 'mbox-short.txt'
fh = open(fname)

for line in fh:
    if not line.startswith('From: '): continue
    pieces = line.split()
    email = pieces[1]
    (emailname, org) = email.split("@")

    cur.execute('SELECT count FROM Counts WHERE org = ? ', (org,))
    row = cur.fetchone()

    if row is None:
        cur.execute('''INSERT INTO Counts (org, count)
                VALUES (?, 1)''', (org,))
    else:
        cur.execute('UPDATE Counts SET count = count + 1 WHERE org = ?',
                    (org,))
    conn.commit()

# https://www.sqlite.org/lang_select.html
sqlstr = 'SELECT org, count FROM Counts ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10'

for row in cur.execute(sqlstr):
    print(str(row[0]), row[1])

cur.close()
```

# Multi-Table Database - Tracks

_**Musical Track Database**_

This application will read an iTunes export file in XML and produce a properly normalized database with this structure:

```Javascript
CREATE TABLE Artist (
    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE, 
    name    TEXT UNIQUE 
);

CREATE TABLE Genre (
    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    name    TEXT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Album (
    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    artist_id  INTEGER,
    title   TEXT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Track (
    id  INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY 
        AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    title TEXT  UNIQUE,
    album_id  INTEGER,
    genre_id  INTEGER,
    len INTEGER, rating INTEGER, count INTEGER
);
```
If you run the program multiple times in testing or with different files, make sure to empty out the data before each run.

You can use this code as a starting point for the application: http://www.py4e.com/code3/tracks.zip. The ZIP file contains the Library.xml file to be used.

The program will run a query like this on your uploaded database and look for the data it expects to see:

SELECT Track.title, Artist.name, Album.title, Genre.name 
    FROM Track JOIN Genre JOIN Album JOIN Artist 
    ON Track.genre_id = Genre.ID and Track.album_id = Album.id 
        AND Album.artist_id = Artist.id
    ORDER BY Artist.name LIMIT 3
    
To export your own Library.xml from iTunes 

>File -> Library -> Export Library

Make sure it is in the correct folder. iTUnes might change UI and/or export format any time

# Many Students in Many Courses

_**Instructions**_

This application will read roster data in JSON format, parse the file, and then produce an SQLite database that contains a User, Course, and Member table and populate the tables from the data file.

Each student gets their own file for the assignment. Download this file and save it as roster_data.json. Move the downloaded file into the same folder as your roster.py program.

Read the above JSON data, run the following SQL command:

SELECT User.name,Course.title, Member.role FROM 
    User JOIN Member JOIN Course 
    ON User.id = Member.user_id AND Member.course_id = Course.id
    ORDER BY User.name DESC, Course.title DESC, Member.role DESC LIMIT 2;
The output should look as follows:
Zuriel|si110|0
Zi|si206|0
Once that query gives the correct data, run this query:
SELECT 'XYZZY' || hex(User.name || Course.title || Member.role ) AS X FROM 
    User JOIN Member JOIN Course 
    ON User.id = Member.user_id AND Member.course_id = Course.id
    ORDER BY X LIMIT 1;
